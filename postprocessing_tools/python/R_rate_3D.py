Description: Reconnection rate for a 3D double-Harris iPIC3D run, computed
             SEPARATELY for the two current sheets (CS1 = lower y, CS2 = upper y).

             This version adds the PAPER-METHOD reconnection rate

                 v_rec = <v_in> / v_out

             (Appendix G) computed from the MASS-WEIGHTED bulk fluid velocity,
             built from the per-species moments rho_s and J_s. It is written and
             plotted SEPARATELY from the flux-function rate; the flux-based
             outputs (R_rate_field_avg.txt, R_rate_plane_avg.txt, ...) are
             untouched.

Paper method as applied here (geometry of THIS code: sheet along x, normal
along y; inflow = y, outflow = x; c=1 so v_x, v_y are already in units of c):

  * v_in  : average of INFLOWING v_y (directed toward the sheet centre) over the
            upstream band  0.3*(Ly/4) <= |y - y_centre| <= 0.8*(Ly/4)  on BOTH
            y-sides of each sheet, scaled from the paper's 0.3..0.8 inflow box.
  * v_out : max |v_x| over the whole (periodic) x-range within the outflow band
            |y - y_centre| <= OUTFLOW_HALF_FRAC*(Ly/4). No x edge-guard is needed
            because x is periodic.
  * v_rec : <v_in> / v_out, per sheet, per cycle. Direct ratio -- no time
            derivative, no vA, no flux function.

Velocity:
  Mass-weighted single-fluid velocity from ALL four species (paper uses the
  fluid velocity v for non-FFE runs):

      V = sum_s (m_s/q_s) J_s  /  sum_s (m_s/q_s) rho_s

  With masses in electron-mass units and mass_ratio = m_i/m_e, the per-species
  weight m_s/q_s is -1 for the two electron species (0,2) and +mass_ratio for
  the two proton species (1,3); the common 1/e cancels between numerator and
  denominator. This is the TRUE center-of-mass velocity, not J_total/rho_total.

Species layout (fixed by the run):
    0 = background electrons   1 = background protons
    2 = current-sheet electrons 3 = current-sheet protons

If ANY of species 0..3 is missing rho, Jx or Jy for a requested cycle, the run
prints the offending dataset path and ABORTS (no partial result).

Method
------
1. Assemble the z-AVERAGED in-plane field <Bx>_z, <By>_z on the global (x,y) grid.
   For z-periodic data,

       d_x <Bx>_z + d_y <By>_z = -<d_z Bz>_z = 0    (exactly)

   so a 2D flux function exists with NO approximation. This measures the
   k_z = 0 ("2D-like") reconnection rate; oblique (k_z != 0) reconnection is
   NOT captured -- use --z-planes to quantify how much that matters.

2. psi(x,y) from   Bx = +d_y psi ,  By = -d_x psi     (i.e. psi = A_z).

3. Split y at nyg//2 (one sheet per half, as in Extract_3D_CS.py). In each half
   locate the neutral line Bx = 0 column by column and take

       dpsi = max(psi_neutral) - min(psi_neutral)   ( = psi_X - psi_O )

   Tracking the neutral line per column (rather than reading psi along a fixed
   y row) keeps this valid once the sheets ripple.

4. R = (1/(B0 * vA)) d(dpsi)/dt, differenced across dumps.

Writes reconnection_rate.txt with dpsi and R for CS1, CS2, total and average.

  ALWAYS WRITTEN, no flag needed:
     R_rate_plane_avg.txt/.png  measure Delta psi on EVERY z-plane, average
                                the RESULTS. Immune to islands sitting at
                                different x for different z.
     R_rate_field_avg.txt/.png  average the FIELD along z (<B>_z and <Ez>_z),
                                then measure once. This is the k_z = 0 mode.
     vrec_paper.txt/.png        PAPER-METHOD rate v_in/v_out for CS1 and CS2,
                                from the mass-weighted species velocity. Written
                                only if per-species moments are present; if they
                                are requested-but-partial the run aborts.

  Each figure has two panels: left from B (d(Delta psi)/dt), right from Ez
  (-c[Ez_X - Ez_O], no time derivative). Four curves that should agree.

  Box lengths are derived from the extents: Lx = xmax - xmin, then dx = Lx/nxc.
  Both the extents and nxc/nyc/nzc are yours to set; the code imposes no
  relation between them beyond that division.
